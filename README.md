# Abhimanyu Pandey — Portfolio

A fast, theme-aware portfolio built with the Next.js App Router. It focuses on clarity, motion used with restraint, and a small, reusable design system based on CSS variables.
The site showcases projects, experience, and a contact form that feeds into Formspree — wrapped in responsive, accessible UI components with a consistent pill aesthetic.

## Highlights

- Theme-aware UI (light/dark) driven by global CSS tokens.
- Motion that serves the content using Framer Motion.
- Projects gallery with title→marquee hover reveal and color-coded cards.
- Experience timeline with responsive pills and an SVG “EXPERIENCE” ring.
- Contact section split into:
- Quick-links (Email, GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, Resume).
- A segregated form (Formspree) with name/email/subject/message + tall “Send” pill.
- Mobile-first layout with careful typography and spacing.
- Accessible interactions (keyboard focus, visible focus rings, semantic labels).
